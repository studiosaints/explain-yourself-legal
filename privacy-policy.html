        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 3, 2025</p>
        <p><strong>App:</strong> Explain Yourself</p>
        <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Studio Saints</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>The Simple Version:</strong> We barely collect anything. Your fun stays private, your data stays yours, and we're not sneaky about it.
        </div>

        <h2>What We Actually Do (Spoiler: Very Little)</h2>
        
        <h3>What We Collect:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User ID:</strong> A random identifier from Apple/Google when you sign in (so we can save your purchases)</li>
            <li><strong>Purchase History:</strong> What packs you've bought (so we can restore them)</li>
            <li><strong>Voice Recordings:</strong> Temporarily processed for AI responses, then immediately deleted</li>
            <li><strong>Game Data:</strong> Your game history and player stats (stored only on your device)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What We DON'T Collect:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your email address</li>
            <li>Your real name</li>
            <li>Your contacts</li>
            <li>Your location (beyond country for legal compliance)</li>
            <li>Your photos</li>
            <li>Anything from your microphone except during gameplay</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Where Your Data Lives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>On your device:</strong> Game history, player profiles, photos you take</li>
            <li><strong>Apple/Google:</strong> Your purchase receipts (we don't control this)</li>
            <li><strong>Our servers:</strong> Just your user ID and purchase info</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Info</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User ID:</strong> To save and restore your purchases</li>
            <li><strong>Voice recordings:</strong> To generate AI responses (then deleted immediately)</li>
            <li><strong>Purchase data:</strong> To unlock the content you paid for</li>
            <li><strong>Country detection:</strong> To show GDPR consent for EU users</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Rights (You're In Control)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Delete your account:</strong> Settings → Delete Account (removes everything)</li>
            <li><strong>Clear your data:</strong> Settings → Clear Game History / Clear Leaderboard</li>
            <li><strong>Control purchases:</strong> Managed through Apple/Google, not us</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who We Share With</h2>
        <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Basically nobody.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AI services:</strong> Voice recordings for processing (immediately deleted)</li>
            <li><strong>Apple/Google:</strong> Purchase verification only</li>
            <li><strong>Nobody else:</strong> We don't sell, rent, or share your data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We use industry-standard security. Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest. But let's be honest - since we barely collect anything, there's not much to worry about.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>This app isn't specifically for kids, but we don't collect personal information from anyone under 13 without parental consent. Actually, we don't collect much personal information from anyone.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If we change this policy, we'll update the date above and let you know in the app. We're not planning any major changes since our approach is "collect as little as possible."</p>

        <div class="contact">
            <h2>Questions?</h2>
            <p>We're real people who actually read emails. Contact us at:</p>

            <p>We typically respond within 24 hours.</p>
